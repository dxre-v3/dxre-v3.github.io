    <p>The number of male and female victims were very close. In fact, in my current sample they are 41,981 female entries and 46,225 male, a difference that, while more than four thousand is relatively close.</p>
    <p>I also noticed the number of NA values, and the number of values that did not appear to be related. Since there were very few of them, I decided to relabel them as unknown sex. I could have set them to NA but I thought that the missing data here could relate to the type of crime or be significant in another way, so I decided to possibly corrupt the unknown category instead.</p>
    <p>I moved on to look at the race of the victims. However, I wanted to see not only if there was trend over time between the race and ethnicity of the victim but what trends each group had for their respective genders.</p>
