    <h1>California ranchers intentionally violated an emergency water order. Now lawmakers want to triple the fines</h1>
    <p class="byline">by Rachel Becker, CalMatters <br>June 9, 2023</p>
    <p>When ranchers <a href="https://d.calmatters.org/environment/2022/08/shasta-river-water-standoff/">violated an
            emergency order</a> to stop pumping water from the drought-plagued Shasta River last year, state officials
        fined them $4,000, or roughly $50 each. Now California legislators are <a
            href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB460">weighing a
            bill</a><em> </em>that would triple fines for such infractions — and could allow the penalty to climb higher
        than a million dollars.</p>
    <p>Authored by <a href="https://a16.asmdc.org/">Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan</a>, a Democrat from San Ramon,
        the bill cleared the Assembly in a 43 to 20 vote last week and is now awaiting discussion in Senate committees.
    </p>
    <p>The proposed legislation aims to give California’s water enforcers more muscle to act swiftly and levy larger
        penalties for water agencies, irrigation districts and landowners who violate state orders and policies by
        pumping from rivers and streams. </p>
    <p>Bauer-Kahan introduced AB 460 after CalMatters reported in November that <a
            href="https://d.calmatters.org/environment/2022/11/california-ranchers-drought-fine/">the state had imposed
            minimal fines</a> on about 80 Siskiyou County ranchers — served by the Shasta River Water Association — who
        had violated an emergency order to stop pumping. The river’s <a
            href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/11517500/#parameterCode=00060&startDT=2022-08-16&endDT=2022-08-26">flows
            plunged by more than half</a>, threatening ecosystems and rare fish such as salmon. </p>
    <p>Yet in a public demonstration of the state’s limited powers, the ranchers kept the pumps on for eight days. </p>
    <p>“Paying the fines was worth it to them to take what they took, and that shows a real weakness in what we have
        done,” Bauer-Kahan said. “It was so clear that our law was not working.”</p>
    <p>The State Water Resources Control Board’s maximum fine under existing law is $500 per day. The state also can
        issue a cease and desist order, which carries maximum fines of $10,000 per day, but it requires a 20-day waiting
        period and allows the users to seek a public hearing. Such provisions allow the violations to continue for
        weeks.</p>
    <p>“The board doesn't have the tools to act quickly,” said <a
            href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/about/people/michael-kiparsky/">Michael Kiparsky</a>, water
        program director at the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at UC Berkeley School of Law. “The fish don't
        care if the lawyers are trying to figure out who's right or wrong if they're dead.”</p>
    <p>Rick Lemos, a fifth generation rancher and board member of the Shasta River Water Association, said the ranchers
        turned their pumps on last August because their cattle were at risk without more water. Costs from hauling water
        and buying hay were climbing, and the ranchers faced the prospect of selling off cattle. </p>

    <p>“We could have kept going for $500 a day,” said Rick Lemos, a fifth generation rancher and board member of the
        Shasta River Water Association.</p>
    <p>Had the Assembly bill been in force then, the ranchers could have faced daily fines between $1,500 and $10,000,
        plus $2,500 for every acre-foot of water diverted, which could reach more than $1,000,000. </p>
    <p>Lemos said if fines had reached $10,000 per day, “we definitely could have had to rethink it. That’s for damn
        sure.” Yet, he also added, "I'm not so sure we wouldn't have done it again. When you got cattle out of water and
        you have no other options, what are you gonna do? "</p>
    <p>“If you’ve got 5,000 head of cattle that are worth $1,200 apiece, and they're starting to die. I mean, how much
        can you spend for eight or 10 days to remedy the problem?” he said.</p>
    <p>The law would target landowners, water agencies and districts that take water from rivers and streams, not
        individual consumers who turn on their taps.</p>
    <p>Sponsored by conservation groups — California Trout, the Planning and Conservation League and Trout Unlimited —
        the bill is also supported by the Karuk and Yurok Tribes.</p>
    <p>“The fine doesn’t fit the crime,” Karuk Tribal Council Member Arron “Troy” Hockaday said. ”What's gonna stop them
        from doing it again this year, or next year? Or anytime they want? I mean, you got 80 farmers only paying $50
        apiece. They're gonna keep doing it.” </p>

    <p>But water providers, builders and agricultural groups oppose the bill, saying it is so broad that even those
        diverting water legally could be ensnared in the expanded water board powers. </p>
    <p>“If (the bill) did nothing else but raise penalties, that would stop what went on on the Shasta,” said Kristopher
        Anderson, the Association of California Water Agencies’ legislative advocate. But he said, by expanding other
        authorities, “this bill systematically stacks the deck against water right holders in favor of the water
        board.” </p>
    <p>One new authority would be issuing interim relief orders to stop diversions or address potential harms. In urgent
        cases, these could take effect immediately “to prevent imminent or irreparable injury to other legal users of
        water, or to instream beneficial uses,” the bill says. Water users who ignore an interim relief order could face
        fines of $10,000 per day and $2,500 per acre-foot diverted. </p>

    <p>Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the State Water Contractors, an association of public water agencies, said
        vague definitions in the bill such as ‘irreparable injury’ create uncertainty over what water would actually be
        available to suppliers in the future, which could impede development. </p>
    <p>Anderson added he would prefer to see enforcement run through the courts rather than state-issued fines — an
        avenue that the water board could have but did not pursue with the Siskiyou County ranchers. </p>
    <p>But water board officials said in the Shasta River case, seeking a court order would have kicked off a lengthy,
        resource-intensive battle.</p>
    <p>“You've got both parties who are going to be subject to extensive litigation and litigation costs,” said <a
            href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/enforcement/director.html">Yvonne West</a>,
        director of the water board’s Office of Enforcement. “We thought we could react quicker… In hindsight, we see
        that we didn't gain the compliance we were hoping for from those initial actions.”</p>

    <p>Bauer-Kahan’s bill is one of several taking aim at the state’s <a
            href="https://d.calmatters.org/explainers/california-water-solutions/#2104d2c3-4a7a-4116-b1c9-3eedc45d49c7">byzantine,
            Gold Rush-era water rights system</a> that state analysts warn <a
            href="https://lao.ca.gov/handouts/resources/2009/water_rights_issues_perspectives_031009.pdf">has promised
            more water</a> than is available. The system, which <a
            href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/about_us/water_boards_structure/history_water_rights.html">establishes
            priority</a> among users, is facing mounting criticism for its history of inequality and exclusion of Native
        peoples and people of color. </p>
    <p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1337">Another bill</a>
        would expand the state’s powers to <a
            href="https://d.calmatters.org/commentary/2023/04/california-water-rights-battle-legislature/">curtail
            pumping from rivers and streams</a> even by water users with claims that pre-date the <a
            href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/board_info/water_rights_process.html">state’s water rights
            law, enacted in 1914</a>. <a
            href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB389">A third</a> would
        allow the board to investigate the legitimacy of senior water rights claims. </p>
    <p>All three face opposition from builders, water providers and agriculture. So far they have cleared their houses
        of origin and are continuing through the Legislature. </p>
    <p>California water watchers say it’s critical to bolster the state's power to enforce water laws. </p>
    <p>“Is the genie out of the bottle now?” Berkeley’s Kiparsky asked. </p>
    <p>“What happens during the next drought now that it’s been very publicly demonstrated that water users can in
        essence treat the water board’s enforcement actions as an additional, and sometimes very modest, cost of doing
        business?”</p>
