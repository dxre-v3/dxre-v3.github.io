<h3>Education: </h3>
<p class = "pad">I have a Bachelor of Science from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University where I double-majored in journalism and statistics and minored in creative writing. </p>

<h3>Work Experience:</h3>
<p class = "pad">I am a Full Stack Web Developer at CalMatters where I work on a variety of challenges. My projects have included a Slack bot that delivers daily newsletter metrics, a WordPress HTML sitemap plugin and a customized WordPress taxonomy that connects articles together into a series. </p>

<p class = "pad">I spent the summer of 2020 as the Engineering Fellow at The Texas Tribune. Despite working remotely, I gained experience in Python, AWS Lambda and regular expressions which allowed me to create two Slack bots and three CMS helpers. </p>

<p class = "pad">Previously, I worked for the Knight Lab at Northwestern University where I researched rendering historic stereographic images as 3-dimensional objects, learning pathways and the Census. I also spent a year as the Interactives Editor for North by Northwestern, a student publication, where I taught students the basics of HTML and CSS. </p>

<h3>Hobbies:</h3>
<p class = "pad">I enjoy writing short stories, poems and novels but I also enjoy sewing dresses, skirts and bags. In my spare time, I may  also be found skateboarding, doodling or cooking.</p>
